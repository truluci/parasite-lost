## About the Game

A parasitic god lives frozen on a piece of ice above the ocean. Due to global warming, a piece of the ice melts and a fragment of the parasite falls into the deep sea. The parasite fragment must navigate the oceanâ€™s dangers, taking over new hosts, and try to return to its original ice fragment.

## Gameplay

- **Lifespan:** The parasite has a limited lifespan (5 seconds).  
  - Crossing from point A to point B might take longer than its lifespan, so players must extend it by taking hosts.
- **Host Mechanic:**  
  - When the parasite enters a hostâ€™s radius, a rhythm battle begins.  
  - A wave flows from host to parasite with glitches (frequency interruptions).  
  - Players must press the spacebar at the right moment to match the rhythm.  
  - Successfully completing the rhythm battle grants the host and increases lifespan.
- **Fish Types:**  
  - Small, medium, and large fish.  
  - Each fish has its own rhythm game music and difficulty.
- **Level Progression:**  
  - Each level features a simple maze.  
  - The parasite must travel from point A (bottom) to point B (top) within a given time.  
  - Lifespan is shorter than the required time, so taking hosts is necessary to survive.
